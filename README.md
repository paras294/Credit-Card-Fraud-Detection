# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Fraud detection solution: This is a feature to detect fraudulent transactions, wherein once a cardmember swipes their card for payment, the transaction is classified as fraudulent or authentic based on a set of predefined rules. If fraud is detected, then the transaction must be declined. Please note that incorrectly classifying a transaction as fraudulent will incur huge losses to the company and also provoke negative consumer sentiment.   Customer information: The relevant information about the customers needs to be continuously updated on a platform from where the customer support team can retrieve relevant information in real-time to resolve customer complaints and queries.
